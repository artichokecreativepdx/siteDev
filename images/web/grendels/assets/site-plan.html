<h1>Planning Guide for My Site</h1>
<p><a href="#">by Megan Maldonado</a></p>
<h2>Goals and Marketing</h2>
<ol>
  <li>The goal of the website is to bring in business from neighboring hotels, businesses and resiential areas. To make Grendels and east Burnside a destination spot.</li>
  <li>The target audience for this webite is, people in the neighborhood who want coffee and sandwiches. East Burnside is developing rapidly and it would be beneficial to let newcomers in the area know what types of thing that we offer. Most of our customers seem to be middle class, in the mid 30's to 50's, both male and female. The closest hotel is the Jupiter Hotel and tends to attract a hip crowd.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Design Concepts</h2>
<ol>
  <li>A hip, quirky, local, coffee shop. A great place to experience the local &quot;color&quot; of Portland... and have a great cup of coffee.</li>
  <li>5 words to describe my site: Informative, Fun, Sassy, Warm, Quirky</li>

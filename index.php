            <p class="passions">I am passionate about design, both web and print, and I do fine art Illustration in my free time&mdash;
                when I have free time. Right now, I am interested in learning more Javascript and PHP,
                as I have come to realize that a lot of small businesses wish to have Wordpress sites. I have messed around with
              some wordpress frameworks and am currently working on a replacement for this site. I would love any feedback people have to offer
              and am constantly striving to improve and learn new things.</p>
